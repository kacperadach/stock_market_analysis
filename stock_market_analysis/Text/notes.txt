Notes:
- tickers with '^' or '.' in them are being excluded
- stock model has field day which is an int value representing the amount of days since the start date in constants

ALGORITHMS:
   - because my algorithms will not analyze in real time, long/short orders will be decided after market close.
   - Then the next day after close, the algorithm will check the stock to see if it was within the percent tolerance
     range during that day.
         - if it was the order will be filled in with appropriate information (start_price)
         - if not it will delete the order
     - I believe this is fair because if the algorithm had realtime data it could just fill these orders during the day
     and my implementation is assuming it was capable of this

     - i might change the update function to take 2 or maybe even 4 parameters for the percent tolerance
        - percent for long/short
        or
        - percent higher, percent lower for both long/short

    - all algorithms should be parameterized by a

TODO:
- fix command to have additional arguments to delete certain data
- add more tests
- implement Algorithms app
    - add at least 1 algorithm
    - add functionality to run on historical data

Indicators to add:
- universal momentum oscilator
- ultimate oscillator
- more oscillators (easy to implement readings when range is restricted)
