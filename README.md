# stock_market_analysis

Right now I am building this to gather stock data about publically traded companies. I plan to add features to scan stocks for buy/sell signals.
I also plan on adding automatic Buying and Shorting which will be tracked and recorded to see how well my automated trading portfolio will perform.
